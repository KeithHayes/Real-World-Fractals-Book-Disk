This program illustrates the terrain rendering technique on a 
32 x 32 terrain model of a hill.  There are 4 classes for the 
hill, divided according to height.  The program shows 4 
different recursion levels on a single screen, and then 
generates the final recursion level (which can take a while so 
be patient) in the final screen.
