Storm.exe illustrates the cloud object class RWFaf_3DCraterObject.  You 
may select the number of clouds to draw in a scene.  After the clouds are 
drawn, simulated lightning flashes between the clouds using 1D fBM to 
create a jagged lightning bolt.  The fBM data specifies how to offset the 
bolt relative to a straight line drawn between 2 cloud centers.  The 
lightning "flash" is created by ramping the color palette after the 
lightning bolt is drawn.
