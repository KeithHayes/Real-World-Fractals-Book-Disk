Night.exe generates a night time scene using the 2D tree 
classes RWFaf_TreeObject and RWFaf_PolyTree.  The moon is modeled 
using the RWFtree_CraterObject class.  There is one basic type 
of tree and then several variety of plants, with all of the 
branching parameters chosen randomly.  This program is very 
similar to plate8.exe, which renders a similar scene in the 
daytime.
